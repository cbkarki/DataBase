# Issue 1.
Converting excel work book to .cvs is trick specially with the white space. They were not properly dected by the Postgresql due to XA00 breaking space due to utF-8 encoding. Specially, ther trailing white space were not detected
The issue was unsurfaced while using anti left joins to detect the new recodes of major_coded which are not present in crosswalk.
lets try R to fix the whitespaces, before uploading .csv to the database. Other cleaning is proformed in database itself.
